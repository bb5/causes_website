                    <h4>Sumatra</h4>

                        <p>
                        The vast majority of Sumatra’s spectacular rainforests have been rampantly destroyed in recent decades to make way for growing swaths of oil palm and rubber plantations. With the growing demand for palm oil, what little forest remains is highly susceptible to deforestation for expanding plantations.
The largest surviving block of rainforest in Sumatra is called the “Leuser Ecosystem” in Aceh province. This 6.4-million-acre tropical wilderness is the last place on Earth where the Critically Endangered Sumatran Rhinoceros, Sumatran Orangutan, Sumatran Elephant and Sumatran Tiger are all found within one ecosystem, and it is the only place in the world capable of supporting the survival of all four species.
An article published in the international journal Science identified this area as one of the most “irreplaceable areas” in the world out of over 175,000 protected areas and proposed sites.
But we have just one chance to protect this last rainforest wilderness in Sumatra.
The threats to this last stand of pristine rainforest and its endangered wildlife in the Leuser Ecosystem are swiftly escalating as plantation owners are actively clearing all unprotected areas of forest.
Within the Leuser Ecosystem sits a proposed 2-million-acre Gunung Leuser National Park. However, lying outside the park’s boundaries are some of the richest biodiversity areas with the most important populations of Sumatran Rhinos, Sumatran Elephants, Sumatran Tigers and Sumatran Orangutans. Rainforest Trust has identified the Kluet watershed as one of the most vital areas for the survival of these spectacular animals.
Working with an experienced and dedicated local partner, Rainforest Trust plans to strategically purchase private properties at the entrance of the Kluet watershed and then establish the 184,795-acre Kluet Wildlife Reserve (approximately the size of New York City), which will be adjacent to the proposed Gunung Leuser National Park.
By controlling access to one of Leuser’s most important watersheds and actively patrolling the boundaries of the reserve, Rainforest Trust can effectively secure the survival of the Sumatran Rhino and many other endangered species. In the process, major threats to this spectacular area will be disabled, halting access for wildlife poaching and the extraction of forest products while ensuring the protection of Leuser’s outstanding biodiversity.

                        To protect one of the Congo’s most biodiverse landscapes, Rainforest Trust is working to establish the 1,194,507-acre Balanga Forest Reserve.  The proposed protected area will strategically expand protection for wildlife beside the Lomami National Park. Your support will also establish highly-trained and well-equipped anti-poaching patrols across the region to protect one of the most important surviving populations of forest elephants as well as threatened primates.
The Congo basin, where the proposed Balanga Forest Reserve is located, encompasses millions of acres in the heart of Africa and holds some of the highest levels of biodiversity on Earth. Habitats ranging from lowland tropical to montane forests, swamps and natural savannas provide refuge for a stunning range of unique wildlife species, some found nowhere else, like the newly discovered Lesula monkey.  Okapis, Bonobos, and a diverse assemblage of birds all find sanctuary in Balanga’s intact old growth rainforests, one of the most pristine wilderness areas in the Congo basin.
Despite the Congo being the second largest area of tropical forest remaining on Earth, it remains the least protected rainforest and most vulnerable to destruction. As the region slowly emerges from decades of conflict, threats to the Congo’s green treasure trove of incredibly rich forests are rapidly rising. We must act now to save it before it is too late.
